I am a manifold topologist studying exotic smoothings of manifold bundles. These are natural extensions of exotic smooth structures on individual manifolds, e.g. Milnor spheres, to the parametrized setting. The key invariant appearing in this area is the higher smooth torsion, an invariant studied independently by Igusa and Klein, Dwyer, Weiss, and Williams, and Bismut and Lott. 

Work on these invariants was pioneered by Igusa and Waldhausen using intricate models for moduli space functors including the Whitehead space, the stable parametrized h-cobordism space, and algebraic K-theory of spaces. In my work I use excisive approximations of these functors, which I model using the n-Disk categories and zero-pointed spaces appearing in work of Ayala and Francis on factorization (co)homology. Coming up with refinements of the higher smooth torsion invariants in this setting gives me the footing I need to execute generalizations of theorems from classical differential topology, such as the Poincare–Hopf theorem, to excisive functors that generalize the Euler characteristic. 

In my thesis I prove a conjecture of Igusa and Goette which states that after rationalizing and stabilizing the dimension there are no exotic smoothings of bundles with even dimensional closed fibers. In practice this means proving a vanishing theorem for a refinement of the higher smooth torsion invariant. This statement is in stark contrast to the odd dimensional setting in which the same authors construct all possible exotic bundles on a given smooth bundle.
