My graduate studies were in manifold topology, specifically exotic smoothings of manifold bundles. These are natural extensions of exotic smooth structures on individual manifolds, e.g. Milnor spheres, to the parametrized setting. The key invariant appearing in this area is the higher smooth torsion, an invariant studied independently by Igusa and Klein, Dwyer, Weiss, and Williams, and Bismut and Lott. 

Work on these invariants was pioneered by Igusa and Waldhausen using intricate models for moduli space functors including the Whitehead space, the stable parameterized h-cobordism space, and algebraic K-theory of spaces. In my work I used excisive approximations of these functors, which I modeled using the n-Disk categories and zero-pointed spaces appearing in work of Ayala and Francis on factorization (co)homology. Coming up with refinements of the higher smooth torsion invariants in this setting allowed me to execute generalizations of theorems from classical differential topology, such as the Poincar&eacute;–Hopf theorem, to excisive functors that generalize the Euler characteristic. 

This work culminated in the proof of the Rigidity Conjecture of Goette and Igusa which states that after rationalizing and stabilizing the dimension there are no exotic smoothings of bundles with even dimensional closed fibers.
