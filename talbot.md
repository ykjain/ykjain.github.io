I am currently an organizer of the MIT Talbot Workshop alongside Calista Bernard, Morgan Opie, and Lucy Yang.

In 2019 Talbot was held in Brady, TX. The topic was moduli spaces of manifolds, mentored by Prof. Soren Galatius and Prof. Oscar Randal-Williams. We made it into the local newspaper!

Here are the [notes](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/741rbybzkif4ngz/AACr9xpeRxcajQi5mPHUfa5Sa?dl=0) for the workshop, originally live TeX-ed by Lucy Yang, and edited by several members of the workshop including myself.

The 2020 workshop, Ambidexterity in Chromatic Homotopy Theory, has been postponed to 2021 and will be held in Nagodoches, TX. It will be mentored by Prof. Jacob Lurie and Prof. Tomer Schlank.
