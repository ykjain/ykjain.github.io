<br>
<p> I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/ewsc">Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center</a> at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, where I work with <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~rigollet/">Prof. Philippe Rigollet</a>, <a href="https://www.carolineuhler.com/">Prof. Caroline Uhler</a>, and <a href="https://weissman.wi.mit.edu/">Prof. Jonathan Weissman</a> on research in machine learning and biology. Specifically, I am developing methods to learn dynamics from multimodal biological data observed in complex systems such as tumor formation.  
  Prior to Fall 2023 I was a Tamarkin Assistant Professor of Mathematics and NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at Brown University, as well as a Research Affiliate at MIT. In June 2021 I completed my PhD in Mathematics at Northwestern University where I worked with with Prof. John Francis. Before that I was an undergraduate student at MIT.</p>
